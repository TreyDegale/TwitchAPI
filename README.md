<h1>Twitch API</h1>

<h3>What?</h3>
Will generate a list of buttons that with a click, will open VLC media player and start the appropriate video(stream).</br>

<h3>Why?</h3>
During Q4 2021 livestreaming platform Twitch started aggressively forcing ads on its users.</br>
At the time, viewing a stream through 3rd party video players would circumvent said ads.</br>
I wanted to make a tool that would make it possible to view my favourite streams with the least possible clicks.</br></br></br>
